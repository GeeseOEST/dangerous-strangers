"""
Takes in the user info, randomizes the other components, and then sends it to the CharacterBuilder class. Once finished, this recieves that back and then prints it out. 
This somewhat makes this file complex as we're not taking the randomization or printing/exporting logic out.I would like to do in order to be able to have some type of adaptor/dependency injection/whatever to be able to substitute different ways of export (pdf, print, view in web page, ...) but for now is a requirement of the CS50 approach to submitting a final project.

    Randomize any aspectsuser hasn't provided via args - Outlined
    DONE Roll ability scores - Outlined
    Hand all off to CharacterBuilder class
        CharacterBuilder class will require Race class, Class class, Background class - to behave as a way of bundling the object itself for use in Python (Maybe?)
